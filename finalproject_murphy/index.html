      <div class="story-body">
      <p>In hockey, there are many different elements that make a winning team. One of the most important to the team is the last line of defense for the team which is the goalie. The NHL is the highest level of play in the world and to be a goalie at the highest level it takes a lot of work and skill to get there and even more to maintain throughout your career. However, what actually makes a top tier goalie in the NHL and how important are goalies actually in the success of a team throughout the regular season and playoffs.</p>

      <p>Firstly, there are many advanced statistics that go into what makes a good goalie. Through different technology like chips in pucks and shot zones many NHL experts can look at different statistics to identify whether or not a goalie is having a good season.</p>

      <p>One of these statistics is expected goal against. This is the stat of the chance of an unblocked shot attempt being a goal. For example, a rebound shot in the slot may have a 50% of going in and be worth 0.5 expected goals, while a shot from the blueline while shorthanded may be worth 0.01 expected goals. The expected value of each shot attempt is calculated by the MoneyPuck Expected Goals model.</p>

      <p>This then leads to the idea that if a goalie in a season has less goals against than expected, than they are playing above expected for the shots that they are seeing.</p>

      <p>Throughout my analysis, I decided to filter out goalies throughout seasons with at least 45 games played in each season respectively and keep the data to 5on5 play only meaning I will not account for any shorthanded or powerplay chances. This will show how a goalie playing a bulk of the games in a season does in the most common scenario which is 5on5 hockey.</p>

      <p>One of the other statistics being used to see how good a goalie is high danger save percentage. That is the save percentage of how many high danger goals they let in from a certain amount of high danger shots. High danger shots are unblocked shot attempts with an over 20% probability of being a goal. High danger shots account for around 5% of shots and around 33% of goals.</p>

      <p>Being able to make high danger saves sometimes in an NHL game is impressive in its own right, but being able to make these saves regularly to help your team from defensive collapses is a sign of a great goalie under pressure and making sprawling desperations saves to keep his team in it.</p>

      <p>The graph below shows the high danger save percentage of goalies with a minimum of 50 games played in the 2023-2024 season.</p>


     <iframe title="High Danger Save Percentage" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-VLA8i" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VLA8i/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>In the graph at the top of the list is Alexander Georgiev who just signed with the reigning Stanley cup champions, Colorado Avalanche and put up a very impressive season to win his team the division. However, his team did lose that year in the first round to the Seattle Kraken.</p>

      <p>Behind him was John Gibson of the Anaheim ducks and Ilya Sorokin of the New York Islanders which both had very impressive numbers, but the Ducks were one of the worst teams in the league last year and the Islanders just squeaked into the playoffs and lost in the first round to the Carolina Hurricanes. This shows that despite a goalie doing everything they can to make diving and last second saves to bail out his team and carry his team on their back, they can’t do it all alone and it doesn’t correlate to great team success. So that begs the question, do goalies actually matter in the NHL?</p>

      <p>A very particular example is Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. The three-time Stanley Cup winner and 2018 Hall of Fame inductee is regarded as one of the best goalies of all time with the NHL’s lead in wins and games played.</p>

      <p>After he retired from the NHL in 2015, people dissected his career to see how successful he was. As more advanced statistics came out, it came out that even though Brodeur was a great goalie, he also had a lot of help from his team.</p>

      <p>The graph below shows the amount of high danger shots on goal for goalies with a minimum of 59 games played in the 2011-2012 season, the season that the devils made it to the Stanley cup final.</p>

      <iframe title="High Danger Shots on Goal" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-968II" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/968II/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="567" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>This graph shows that Matin Brodeur had the least amount of high danger shots against among goalies that have played 59 games. According to a sports agent who regularly works with goalies, many of the great goalies are a part of the team’s defensive structure and Martin Brodeur is one of the prime examples.</p>

      <p>Because of the neutral zone trap defense that the Devils played, this held the opposing team to low danger shots on the perimeter of the ice instead of high danger shots in the middle of the ice. This created Brodeur’s job a lot easier during his tenure with the devils even with him going up in age he was still playing very well and grew acclimated to the devil’s system and what types of shots he would see every night.</p>

      <p>This shows that even though you need a good goalie for team success that can be your last line of defense your team also has to be good at communication with the goalie to have good success. According to a sports agent who regularly works with goalies, goalies are very important and some would say the most important to the success of the team, but the more you make the goalies life easier, the better they will do and the more success the team will have.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, the goalies are important to the success of a team in the NHL, but it also takes a team effort to get the team over the hump and win the Stanley cup.</p>
